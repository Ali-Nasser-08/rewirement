# The Science of Well-Being: Rewirement Workbook

> [!abstract] Course Context
> This workbook is based on Yale's "The Science of Well-Being" course. It tracks your progress through the "Rewirement" challenges—habits designed to increase happiness and build productive routines.

---

## 📊 Phase 1: Baseline Measurement
**Week 1 - Starting Point**

Before starting the rewirement challenges, establish your baseline.

> [!INFO] Measuring Happiness
> To establish a baseline, measure your happiness using a validated scale (like the PERMA Profiler or Authentic Happiness Inventory).
>
> **The Goal:** Have a concrete "before" number to compare with your "after" result in Week 10.
> 
> **The PERMA Model:**
> Happiness isn't just one thing. It's often broken down into 5 pillars:
> * **P**ositive Emotions (joy, gratitude)
> * **E**ngagement (flow, losing track of time)
> * **R**elationships (connection, support)
> * **M**eaning (purpose, serving something bigger)
> * **A**ccomplishment (goals, mastery)

### Baseline Scores
*Rate the following on a scale of 0–10:*

| Metric | Score (0-10) |
| :--- | :---: |
| **P**ositive Emotions | |
| **E**ngagement | |
| **R**elationships | |
| **M**eaning | |
| **A**ccomplishment | |
| Health | |
| Negative Emotions | |

## 📅 Phase 2: Weekly Challenges

### Week 1: Signature Strengths

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Signature Strengths
> Your "Signature Strengths" are the character traits that feel most essential to who you are (e.g., curiosity, kindness, bravery).
>
> **The Challenge:** Identify your top 4 strengths and use one of them in a **new way** every day for 7 days. This builds confidence and flow.

### Week 2: Savoring & Gratitude

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Savoring
> Savoring is the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it. It forces you to slow down and locks in the memory.
>
> **Techniques:**
> * **Share it:** Tell someone else about the moment.
> * **Memory Building:** Take a mental (or physical) photo.
> * **Self-Congratulation:** Remind yourself how lucky you are.
> * **Sharpen Perception:** Focus on specific sensory details (smell, sound).

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Gratitude
> Gratitude rewires your brain to scan for the positive.
>
> **The Challenge:** Every night, write down **5 things** you are grateful for. They can be huge (promotion) or tiny (good coffee).
> *Key: Don't just list them. Relive the feeling of why you are grateful as you write.*

>
> **The Challenge:** Perform **7 acts of kindness** this week. They can be small: holding a door, buying a coffee for a stranger, sending an encouraging text, or donating to a cause.

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Social Connection
> Social connection is the strongest predictor of happiness. Even brief interactions with strangers matter.
>
> **The Challenge:** Make one new connection per day (chat with a barista, talk to someone on the bus).
> **Deepen:** Once this week, spend a solid hour connecting with someone you care about deeply.

### Week 4: Exercise & Sleep

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Exercise
> Exercise is not just for the body; it's a potent antidepressant.
>
> **The Goal:** Move your body for at least **30 minutes** a day.
> **What counts?** Anything. Walking, yoga, dancing in your room, gym. Just get your heart rate up and notice the mood boost afterwards.

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Sleep Hygiene
> Sleep deprivation kills mood and cognitive function.
>
> **The Goal:** Get at least **7 hours** of sleep for 4 nights this week.
> **How:** No screens 30 mins before bed; No caffeine after 2 PM; Make your room dark and cool.

### Week 5: Meditation & Letter

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Meditation
> Meditation builds the muscle of attention, allowing you to get off the "hedonic treadmill" of constant wanting.
>
> **The Goal:** Meditate for **10 minutes** every day.
> **How:** Focus on your breath. When your mind wanders (and it will), gently bring it back. That "bringing back" is the rep.

> [!TIP] Learning Concept: Gratitude Letter
> This is a "nuclear" happiness boost. Write a letter (300+ words) to someone who changed your life but whom you never properly thanked.
>
> **The Visit:** Ideally, meet them in person or call them, and read the letter *out loud* to them. It creates a powerful shared moment.

**Tracker: Meditated 10+ mins**
- [ ] Day 1
- [ ] Day 2
- [ ] Day 3
- [ ] Day 4
- [ ] Day 5
- [ ] Day 6
- [ ] Day 7

**Gratitude Letter Draft:**
> *Write your letter here...*

**Status:**
- [ ] I have delivered/read this letter to the person.

## 🚀 Phase 3: The Final Challenge
**Weeks 6 - 10**

> [!example] The Goal
> You've sampled the buffet of habits. Now pick **ONE** to master.
>
> **The Commitment:** Practice your chosen rewirement (e.g., meditation, savoring) for 4 weeks straight. This is about neuroplasticity—rewiring your brain for the long term.

> [!INFO] Technique: WOOP Your Goal
> Use the WOOP method to stick to your plan:
> * **W**ish: What do you want?
> * **O**utcome: How will it feel?
> * **O**bstacle: What inner thought stops you?
> * **P**lan: If [obstacle], then I will [action].
